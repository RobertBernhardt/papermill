            abstract: 'This study investigates recurring semiotic patterns between Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and modern emoji, focusing specifically on how visual elements persist in written communication across vastly different technological eras. I reject simplistic equations between these systems, but argue that examining their functional similarities reveals something fundamental about human communication needs. Building on work from Barthes (1977) and contemporary digital communication scholars like McCulloch (2019), I show how both systems exhibit economic efficiency, cultural embedding, and aesthetic dimensions that speak to deeper patterns in multimodal expression. My comparative approach challenges linear narratives of writing system evolution and contributes to emerging scholarship on digital communication. Despite their obvious differences in complexity and purpose, both hieroglyphics and emoji reflect a stubborn human resistance to purely abstract text—a finding with implications for how we conceptualize writing system development and digital communication practices. Rather than seeing emoji as a regression to pictographic writing, I reframe them as the latest iteration of our enduring impulse toward visual-verbal hybridization.',

            abstract: 'This dissertation examines internet memes as complex sociocultural artifacts that simultaneously fragment and connect digital communities. Through theoretical analysis and interdisciplinary investigation, the research explores how memetic content serves as a mechanism for identity formation in contemporary online environments. The study reveals that memetic literacy establishes micro-generational boundaries while enabling novel connections that transcend traditional demographic categories. By analyzing the unprecedented speed of memetic evolution, this research demonstrates how digital artifacts compress nostalgia cycles and establish unique generational markers through shared experiences of cultural change. The dissertation explores how platform architectures, algorithmic systems, and commercial integration shape memetic ecosystems. It further conceptualizes the shift from inherited to actively constructed identities through participation in digital cultural spaces. This research contributes to scholarly discourse by positioning memes not as trivial internet phenomena but as windows into emerging social structures that illustrate fundamental tensions of digital existence: connection versus isolation, democracy versus hierarchy, and permanence versus transience. These findings have significant implications for identity theory, digital sociology, cultural studies, and communication research in increasingly digitally-mediated societies.',

            abstract: 'Let\'s be honest \\- pillow forts don\'t exactly scream "serious architecture." But that\'s precisely why they\'re worth studying. This thesis digs into those flimsy blanket-and-cushion structures that kids (and fun adults) build in living rooms, seeing them not as childish play but as revealing architectural moments.\n\nWhile "real" architecture obsesses over permanence and expertise, I argue that these temporary constructions actually tell us something fundamental about how humans relate to their surroundings. Drawing from theories on embodied knowledge and spatial agency (but without drowning in academic jargon), I show how pillow forts naturally incorporate principles that professional architects sometimes forget \\- things like human comfort, material efficiency, and the ability to change on the fly.\n\nWhat makes pillow forts particularly interesting is how they blur the lines between designer, builder, and occupant. The same person handles all three roles, creating immediate feedback that allows the structure to evolve in real-time. I\'m not suggesting architects should abandon buildings for blankets (that would be ridiculous), but rather that these humble constructions might remind the profession of its core purpose: creating spaces that actually work for the humans using them.\n\nThe findings have implications for how we teach architecture, how we might approach participatory design, and how we could design more adaptable buildings in our environmentally uncertain future. Sometimes the most obvious insights are the ones we most need reminding of.',

            abstract: 'Let\'s face it: pineapple on pizza divides people like nothing else. But beyond the tired food fight lies something fascinating for economists: a perfect case study in how markets handle our most polarized preferences. This paper examines how markets manage to satisfy wildly divergent tastes without forcing anyone to eat crow (or pineapple). While political systems typically create winners and losers through majority rule, markets excel at letting both camps get exactly what they want.\n\nThrough my analysis of actual pizza menus, pricing strategies, and restaurant positioning, I\'ve identified several key ways markets handle these preference gulfs: neutral menu options, niche pizza joints that cater to one camp, opportunities for food choices to signal identity, and the development of consumer information networks that help pineapple-lovers find their people (and help traditionalists avoid fruity abominations).\n\nBuilding on work by Buchanan and Tullock (1962) on public choice theory, Akerlof and Kranton (2000) on identity economics, and my own field research, this paper argues that these market mechanisms represent an underappreciated aspect of how free markets function in diverse societies. When preferences are particularly polarized – increasingly common in our fragmented world – markets shine by making our disagreements irrelevant to whether we can each satisfy our preferences. The theoretical framework I\'ve developed here has surprising implications for policymakers working in domains characterized by persistent preference divides.',

            abstract: 'This thesis investigates the spontaneous governance systems that emerge on playgrounds, focusing on the swing set as a contested resource. Through observational analysis, the research explores how children navigate resource scarcity without formal regulatory structures. Children develop various mechanisms including procedural authority claims, distributive justice arguments, and strategic compliance behaviors. Drawing on frameworks from developmental psychology and political sociology, this analysis positions the playground as a sociopolitical space where basic patterns of human resource negotiation can be observed taking their first form.\n\nSignificant parallels exist between playground governance mechanisms and adult political systems, suggesting that certain aspects of political behavior may emerge naturally from human interaction rather than exclusively through formal education. While avoiding deterministic claims about the relationship between childhood play and adult politics, this thesis proposes that playground interactions offer valuable insights into how governance concepts develop and how humans balance individual desires against social constraints. These findings contribute to our understanding of how governance patterns emerge organically in human groups and how procedural power operates in both formal and informal contexts.',

            abstract: 'Traditional productivity literature often frames procrastination as merely a deficiency to overcome. This paper challenges that notion by exploring procrastination through a computational lens, recasting it as a particular form of resource optimization that emerges under certain constraints. By drawing unexpected parallels between human behavior and computational resource allocation, we introduce "Recursive Procrastination Sort" (RPS)—a theoretical model that formalizes how tasks are naturally reprioritized as deadlines loom. The mathematical underpinnings of deadline-proximity-based prioritization reveal how this seemingly counterproductive behavior might actually reflect an intuitive grasp of just-in-time resource allocation. While procrastination undoubtedly sacrifices performance consistency, it nonetheless functions as a heuristic that conserves immediate cognitive energy while still (usually) meeting end requirements. The insights from this conceptual framework challenge conventional approaches to optimization and hint at alternative directions for task management system design. Far from advocating increased procrastination, this analysis sheds light on how counterintuitive behavioral patterns might inform novel computational approaches to managing limited resources under temporal constraints.',
